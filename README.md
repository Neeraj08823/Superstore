## 📌 Overview

This project is part of the **Data Analyst Internship Task 2**, focusing on mastering **data visualization and storytelling** using real-world sales data. The dataset captures transactions from a Superstore across multiple years, including product categories, customer segments, sales metrics, and shipping details.

Using **Tableau**, we transformed raw data into visual insights that highlight trends, inefficiencies, and growth opportunities to support data-driven decision-making.
